Prior to bootstrapping the respective datasets need to be preprocessed. For this, the steps in "preprocessing.R" are needed. Adjust the code to your own dataset and depending on the available features. 


## Federated learning
"6_anonymized_profiles_for_sharing.R" anonymizes the learned profile distributions and the result can be shared for later merging with existing profiles.
